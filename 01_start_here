https://jazz.net/forum/questions/66964/xml-with-api-to-create-category-hiearchies-categorytype
I am trying to use the URL utility to gather the data,
modify it and upload it again to create a hierachy for categories taht can be applied to test artifacts in an RQM project.


To keep things easy and accessible I will use my RQM 5.0 sandbox sample project at jazz.net

There is a there is a bi-directional dependency between category/categoryType, 
but only qm:category.qm:categoryType is required. 


1) Create initial categoryType XML files 
    with DependsOn attributes set BUT NO INCLUSION of category references. PUT these to project.

2) Create initial category XML files that will appear in each CategoryType 
    (these must reference the CategoryType XML previously PUT) and then PUT all the categories.

3) Now EDIT the original CategoryType files to now include valueset (key+values) 
    into the orignal files and re-PUT these files.

I now have the completed structure 
    that I expect and can now PUT all my test cases and other material into the project correctly.
