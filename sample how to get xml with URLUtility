To help us identify the root cause, I would like to suggest you to use
the RESTClient to retrieve the XML form of the test case to see if the
incorrect data retrieval is causing the said behavior.

Please use the RQM utility called "RQMURLutility', a jar file which can
be used to GET the XML format of the test case in RQM.
Here are the steps :-

a. Download the RQM url utility tool for RQM v4.0.5 from :

https://jazz.net/downloads/rational-quality-manager/releases/4.0.5/RQM-Extras-RQMUrlUtil-4.0.5.zip

b. Unzip the contents to a folder on the machine with access to the RQM
v4.0.5 server.
c. Open a command line, change directory to the folder containing the
"RQMUrlUtility.jar" file.
d. Run the command as below:

java -jar RQMUrlUtility.jar -command GET -user clmadmin -password
clmadmin -filepath C:\\tsuite.xml -url
"
https://clmserver:port/qm/service/com.ibm.rqm.integration.service.IIntegrationService/resources/TestPrj
(Quality
Management)/testsuite/urn:com.ibm.rqm:testsuite:305"

 NOTE : please replace the clm hostname, port and user, password,
project name and the test suite number (testsuite:305 means the test
suite to be exported to XML here is the test suite with id '305', check
under "view test suites" for the test suite id) with the relevant
details.

Please share the following:-
-- snapshots of the test suite showing the fields mentioned in your
previous email
-- xml file downloaded using steps above (tsuite.xml)
