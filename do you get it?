All commands and scenario can be found here:
https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/RQMURLUtility

It uses the RQM API
https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/RqmApi


for starters:
java -jar RQMUrlUtility.jar -help

It handles the login and more for a specific RQm server and project.
The idea is to create the xml you need for creating your desired artifacts, be it test cases plans etc.
Then create a script that uses the URLUtility and make the upload/creation automatic.
