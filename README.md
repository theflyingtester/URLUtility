RQM URLUtility
==========

Providing the steps that let you use RQM URL Utility for setting category hierarchy for test artifacts in RQM.

Usual import of test artifacts does not acknowledge the hierarchy of categories that you created in the RQM UI.

You either end up with artifacts that cannot be saved, because of mismatching hierarchy or spend a lot of time creating the correct categories and values up front in the UI. 
To give some automation the URLUtility gives oyu a head start on connceting to an RQM server and lets you
 do GET's and PUT's and POST's.
