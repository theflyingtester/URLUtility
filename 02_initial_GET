The basics for a GET to RQM:


In case you want to GET test case or plan, 
you need to GET those URI's

Test Case: http://SERVERNAME:PORT/qm/service/com.ibm.rqm.integration.service.IIntegrationService/resources/PROJECTNAME/testcase/urn:com.ibm.rqm:testcase:TESTCASEID

Test Plan: http://SERVERNAME:PORT/qm/service/com.ibm.rqm.integration.service.IIntegrationService/resources/PROJECTNAME/testplan/urn:com.ibm.rqm:testplan:TESTPLANID 

My server is called
https://jazz.net/sandbox02-qm/web/console
Since I am not yet sure what the excat URL for my project is I will do an initial GET to find out about it:

GET https://jazz.net/sandbox02-qm/service/com.ibm.rqm.integration.service.IIntegrationService/resources/projects
gives me the Alias:
asq%27s+Project+%28Quality+Management%29
and the full URL I will use for the 
REST Client
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/
before transfering everything into the 
URLUtility
https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/RQMURLUtility


https://jazz.net/sandbox02-qm/service/com.ibm.rqm.integration.service.IIntegrationService/resources/asq%27s+Project+%28Quality+Management%29/projects/asq%27s+Project+%28Quality+Management%29

From the article I already know I need to create an `empty' categoryType first.
I will do a GET that lists all categoryTypes I have already to see how the xml needs to look like.
