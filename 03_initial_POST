POST to those URI's to create a new artifact

Test Case: 
http://SERVERNAME:PORT/qm/service/com.ibm.rqm.integration.service.IIntegrationService/resources/PROJECTNAME/testcase/urn:com.ibm.rqm:testcase

Test Plan: 
http://SERVERNAME:PORT/qm/service/com.ibm.rqm.integration.service.IIntegrationService/resources/PROJECTNAME/testplan/urn:com.ibm.rqm:testplan

The response will have a 200 OK return code and the xml returned will hold the id for the new artifact if your posted xml was good.
Start debugging when you see a different return code.

If you write your own java code instead of using the URL utility
the Project Name should be decoded by using URLEncoder.encode(projectname, HTTP.UTF_8)
